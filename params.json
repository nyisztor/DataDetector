{"name":"Datadetector","tagline":"Demo app showcasing NSDataDetector.","body":"### What is NSDataDetector?\r\nNSDataDetector is a handy class which can accurately match data types found in complicated expressions. Just pass in your strings, and the API will tell whether it is an address, a phone number, a link or a date. \r\nSee also this great article that inspired me in wringing this demo app:\r\n[NSDataDetector on NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/nsdatadetector/)\r\n\r\n### How it works?\r\nRun the project on the Simulator or a real device. Note that the minimum deployment target is iOS 7.0.\r\nIn the ViewController.m check out the `- (IBAction)stringChanged:(UITextField*)sender` method. The data detection work is done via the `NSDataDetector enumerateMatchesInString:` API call. The only precondition is to properly initialize the NSDataDetector instance (see ViewController viewDidLoad method).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKaroly Nyisztor (@Carlos001)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ncarlos@nyisztorkaroly.org\r\nwww.leakka.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
